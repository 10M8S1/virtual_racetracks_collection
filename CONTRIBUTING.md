## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues, as well as accept pull requests.

## All Race Track Contribuitions Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to contribute a new virtual race track. We actively welcome your pull requests. Please perform the following steps:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Whenever you want to contribute a new race track, please **create a new branch** with name 'race-track-' followed by 8 random alphanumeric characters.    Always make a new branch, this is a good habit to get in, and will make your life easier.  
3. All race tracks contribuited should be located inside the `launch` folder.
4. Your race track launch file should have the same name as the branch with extension `.launch` at the end.
4. Ensure the race track displays correctly in Rviz.
5. Make sure your commits do not delete submissions from others.
6. Submit your pull request!
7. Sometimes a PR in review might get a comment. Please be responsive to any questions and comments or otherwise you PR will not be merged.

- Give it a clear name that sumarizes what the pull request is about.
- Briefly describe the characteristics and design considerations of your race track.
- Try to be specific in describing what is different.
- Add a screenshot if you can.
